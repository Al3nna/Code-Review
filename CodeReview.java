    Code Reviewed by alenna.castaneda@oneidaihla.org

 * Main.java Line 53: This comment being below the code doesn't match the rest of the file's comment position. Putting this comment above the code line will make it easier to read.

 *Reflection:
    Code review was not too hard. It helped that Logan left good comments, and had organized his code well.
    It's harder than reviewing my own code though, probably because it's easier to understand what's going on when I wrote it.
